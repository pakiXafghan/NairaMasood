                    <p>Assalamu alaikum Nairek,<br />
                        Yeah I miss you a lot and I didn't want to text you after I said that we shouldn't talk,
                        and so here I am. I want to keep you updated on my life cuz I know you're down badddd
                        and you can't survive 2 weeks without me, so I hope this make it easier for you. Guess what,
                        I remade the video that you were drooling over... Idk if I can link full videos through this cuz
                        it'll take up too much storage. I'm gonna try to upload the video and then put it in here for you to see.
                        You know whats crazy, my hand always hurts when I write in the journal, and now my forearms are burning cuz
                        of all this typing. SubhanAllah, I go through pain no matter what, but its okay cuz its for me. I am soooo excited
                        for the future, you don't even know. I think about you 24/7 and I plan everything I want to say and do with you.
                        Even seeing you for half a second today made me so happy. I saw safwaan being funny and he kept reversing the car
                        and I knew he was doing it to annoy you cuz I was there. I was about to hop out and park the car for him xD.
                        Anyways, I tried to do my dars today but I couldnt submit it. I was getting very fustrated. There were so many new words
                        that even after 90 minutes of trying to memorize, I couldn't submit it without forgetting or messing up. I wish you were there to calm me down
                        cuz I was getting really annoyed but I decided to take a break today and do it tomorrow. We have been
                        talking every night for the past few days and so I miss you extra rn, more than usual. Ok ok, enough. I want to show you the gym video I recorded
                        for you. Hold up, let me go google how to show you through this website.
                        <br /><br />
                        I figured it out... It took like an hour, its 12:12 AM now. Anyways, click the link and it should show you the video in full screen &#128527;

                <p>Assalamu alaikum Nairehhhhhh,<br />
                    Wish I could be with you right now. These past few days have been so hard on me physically because
                    my desires are so high and the fact there we're sooooo close to making this fully halal, is making me super hype and yeah, you already know. We both had to take showers yesterday when we woke up...
                    Moving on, I spoke to Shiekh Abdul-Hadi today and I basically introduced myself to him and told him I am 20 and want to get married,
                    and that I have someone in mind, Mr.Shafiq Rahim's daughter. He said, "Sohaila? She's a beautiful and well-manner girl," and then he kept complementing
                    your whole family and especially agha. He mentioned that he has taught all of your siblings and that you guys are a very practicing and good family. Hearing that made me
                    very happy. I also asked him to kind of convince my family to strive for nikkah instead waiting til I graduate. He said he is against the whole "waiting til graduation"
                    especially when the couple are interested in each other. He said, in that case, they should not delay nikkah at all. So yeah, I think my dad is going to go speak with him either today,
                    Sunday, or in the next few days... Soooo I'm finally proposing Nairek. It's happening!!! Don't stress out, Sheikh knows me and sees in the masjid often and I am sure he will
                    say good things about me to agha. And plus, you're going to tell him you're interested in me, and so both of these things will convince agha إن شاء الله. I love you Naira. I love you so much.
                    I love you so much, that I can't put it into words. Saying ILY is not enough to describe my love for you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life in this dunya and for ETERNITY in Jannah.
                    I never want to forget you or lose you. Please always beg Allah for us to be together in both worlds. Just a little more sabr habibti, and I am all yours. - Apka honay wala shohar إن شاء الله <hr />

                    <p>Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatu Sohaila,<br/> 
                        I can't tell you how many times I've stopped myself from texting you in the last 48 hours. I feel like I'm missing a part of my life
                        whenever we're not interacting. I feel like I went 4 months in the past, back when I didnt know you and my everyday was just ordinary, nothing to
                        look forward to. I have so much love for you trapped inside my heart and it's so painful. I know you feel the same so I know that you can relate.
                        I was annoyed today cause my dad spent 6 hours on putting up the new TV... A simple 1 hour job took him 6 hours cuz he made it soooooo complicated.
                        I was so heated and wanted to be disrespectful but held myself back, mainly because it's haram for me, but also because I need my parent's help with marrying you.
                        I can't jeopardize us getting married because of me losing my cool for 5 minutes. Moments like those make me want to be with you even more. I look forward to 
                        you comforting me and cooling me down in moments like that. I crave your support and affection so much, especially when I'm not having good days. The TV thing also
                        annoyed me cuz the whole day was wasting, and there was no progress made in our situation. That's what I thought atleast.
                        SubhanAllah, I was annoyed because my dad didn't go to the masjid today to talk to sheikh, but sheikh wasn't even there today. Wallah, Allah is the best of planners.
                        Naira I want to call you so bad right now, and I know you will answer. That's why its even harder. Even hearing you breathe while you slept that one time, I miss it.
                        I miss you calling me chumpkin. I miss you watching me play my game while you hype me up one round, and then call me trash the next. I just want to spend all my time with you.
                        Every hardship and time of ease. I know you would struggle with me, and to be honest, the way you are makings me love you sooooooooo much. You have no idea how much I love you
                        simply because YOU love me. Knowing that I have someone so supportive, loving, caring, beautiful, and funny, waiting to marry me, makes me want to be the best husband in the world.
                        I, Sufyan Masood, promise you, Naira Rahim, that I will never purposely hurt you, or oppress you, and I promise to love you til my last breath in this dunya, and I promise
                        to love you forever in Jannah. All I ask from you, is to love me back, always support me, and to never give up on me. Mein apsay bohot ishq
