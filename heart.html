                    <p>Assalamu alaikum Nairek,<br />
                        Yeah I miss you a lot and I didn't want to text you after I said that we shouldn't talk,
                        and so here I am. I want to keep you updated on my life cuz I know you're down badddd
                        and you can't survive 2 weeks without me, so I hope this make it easier for you. Guess what,
                        I remade the video that you were drooling over... Idk if I can link full videos through this cuz
                        it'll take up too much storage. I'm gonna try to upload the video and then put it in here for you to see.
                        You know whats crazy, my hand always hurts when I write in the journal, and now my forearms are burning cuz
                        of all this typing. SubhanAllah, I go through pain no matter what, but its okay cuz its for me. I am soooo excited
                        for the future, you don't even know. I think about you 24/7 and I plan everything I want to say and do with you.
                        Even seeing you for half a second today made me so happy. I saw safwaan being funny and he kept reversing the car
                        and I knew he was doing it to annoy you cuz I was there. I was about to hop out and park the car for him xD.
                        Anyways, I tried to do my dars today but I couldnt submit it. I was getting very fustrated. There were so many new words
                        that even after 90 minutes of trying to memorize, I couldn't submit it without forgetting or messing up. I wish you were there to calm me down
                        cuz I was getting really annoyed but I decided to take a break today and do it tomorrow. We have been
                        talking every night for the past few days and so I miss you extra rn, more than usual. Ok ok, enough. I want to show you the gym video I recorded
                        for you. Hold up, let me go google how to show you through this website.
                        <br /><br />
                        I figured it out... It took like an hour, its 12:12 AM now. Anyways, click the link and it should show you the video in full screen &#128527;
